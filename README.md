# ChatBot
<b>Chatbot project for Data Rep and Querying GMIT year 3</b><br />

<b>Description</b><br />
This project is based on the famous Eliza chatbot. It is written in goLang, JavaScript and HTML. Regular expressions are also used. <br />
When certain keywords are entered by the user, e.g. "Hello",<br />
the bot responds with a variety of answers e.g. "Hello... I'm glad you could drop by today.", "Hi there... how are you today?", "Hello, how are you feeling today?"
The HTML interface is designed with BootStrap, an open source software for easily styling HTML.<br />
I based my project theme around  the WhatsApp messaging application,<br />
using a similar colour scheme and right aligned text box for user input and left aligned text box for bot responses.<br /><br />
